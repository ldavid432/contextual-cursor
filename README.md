Contextual Cursor</h1>
Remember how RSHD had a custom mouse cursor when you hovered over stuff? Well it's (mostly) back!

### Missing Features vs RSHD (and other known issues):
* RL tooltips are partially underneath the cursor when they're displayed below the cursor
* Many things that should have contextual cursors don't. Feel free to make an issue suggesting them.
* Many menu options have overlapping functions which currently result in incorrect cursors. These will be addressed in a future update.
  * `Check` on items shows the hunter cursor
  * `Harvest` on dead sea monsters shows the farming cursor
  * `Clean` on dirty arrow tips shows the herblore cursor
